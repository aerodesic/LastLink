# channel table parameters for datarates:
#   spread-factor (or sf) specifies the the spread-factor code
#   bandwidth (or bw) specifies the channel bandwidth
#   txpower (or tx) gives the starting tranmission power for the datarate.
#   payload is the nominal number of bytes per packet for international channel dwell time.
#   coding-rate (or cr) is the coding rate for the bits sent.  All expressed in 4/N form.
